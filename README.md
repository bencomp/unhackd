# Unhackd

Earn OpenBadges in the Coding CAFE.

This project is currently mostly a list of ideas.
Its scope and roadmap have not yet been fully developed.

## Ideas

What if Hacktoberfest is not limited to one month, so you can take your time
for contributions?
What if the badges you earn for contributions are more varied and can be
transferred to other platforms, because they are [OpenBadges]?

The combination of earning badges for trying new things, or participating in
(temporary) targeted activities, and coding, reminded me of Untappd.
It is not new, because GitHub allows users to [display Achievements on their
profiles][achievements].
I also like the idea of allowing others to suggest new potential achievements,
which GitHub does not currently support.
However, one can laugh at [GitHub achievements that did not make the cut][ra].

The best place to earn these badges is not a business whose interest is to
collect as much data about participants, to make money from their data.
These badges should be awarded by people who value your achievements and who
may help you work towards them.
I think these people can be found in local programming communities
that encourage you to *Code Along and Feel Empowered*, following the [CAFE
Playbook][CAFE].

## Example badges / challenges

Tasks, some more challenging than others, that a badge may be awarded for:

- Make link texts more descriptive
- Archive a project with a note in the README file
- Remove Google Analytics from a project

See the [Index of badges and challenges](badges/index.md) for all ideas.
